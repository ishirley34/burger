# burger

This is a burger app. Start by adding your MySQL password to the connection.js file. Then run server.js with node and open your browser to http://localhost:8080 to see the app.


This app allows you to add burgers and then eat them. The app will then display all of the burgers that have been eaten.

Enjoy!
